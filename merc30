When the batarians hit
It all fell apart gradually.
It's funny. When you are low on thermal clips, a battle becomes simple math. How to kill the most batarians with the least shots. Shepard now knew one slug from the mantis, with the correct mods can shoot through two batarian head. You just had to wait for them to line up. She hated to think about it as target practice, but after countless shots fired, you just fell into the rhythm. Tactical cloak up, go to the place from where you can take out at least two, aim carefully, shoot. Batarian heads explode just like jugs full of jam. She shook her head. This is not good, you have to think about them as persons. Bad persons, pirates, mercs, here to kill the civilians, they need to be killed, but you can't think of them as objects.
She was sweating, the helmet couldn't hold it back anymore. It stang her eyes, and made its way down along her spine, causing a distraction to her concentration.
